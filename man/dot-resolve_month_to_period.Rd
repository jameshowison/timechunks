\title{Resolve a two-digit month string to a period index}
\usage{
.resolve_month_to_period(mm_str, year, calendar)
}
\description{
YYYYM month resolution compares month numbers, not exact dates. This means
August maps to Fall even though Fall starts Aug-23 (not Aug-01). This
matches institutional practice where month codes denote the term.
}
\details{
Resolution order:
\enumerate{
\item Explicit yyyym_map override
\item Find all periods whose start month (MM) <= given month; pick highest
\item If none qualify (given month is before the earliest start month in the
year), pick the last period (wraps to the period that crosses into this
month from the previous year)
}
